        <strong>Terms &amp; Conditions</strong>
        <p>
          By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply
          to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully
          before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy or modify the app,
          any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed
          to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also
          shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages or make
          derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks,
          copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights
          related to it, still belong to Owlchat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Owlchat is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and
          efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make
          changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for
          any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services
          without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Owlchat app stores and processes personal data that you have
          provided to us, to provide our Service. It’s your responsibility to
          keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend
          that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
          removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official
          operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable
          to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s
          security features and it could mean that the Owlchat app won’t work
          properly or at all.
        </p>
        <div>
          <p>
            The app does use third-party services that declare their Terms and
            Conditions.

        <p>
          You should be aware that there are certain things that Owlchat will
          not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require
          the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be
          Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but Owlchat cannot
          take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if
          you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data
          allowance left.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should
          remember that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network
          provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your
          mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the
          connection while accessing the app, or other third-party charges. In
          using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges,
          including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home
          territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming.
          If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the
          app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission
          from the bill payer for using the app.
        </p>
        <p>
          Along the same lines, Owlchat cannot always take responsibility for
          the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device
          stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to
          avail the Service, Owlchat cannot accept responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          With respect to Owlchat’s responsibility for your use of the app, when
          you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we
          endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do
          rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make
          it available to you. Owlchat accepts no liability for any loss, direct
          or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this
          functionality of the app.
        </p>
        <p>
          At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently
          available on Android &amp; iOS – the requirements for the both
          systems(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the
          availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download
          the updates if you want to keep using the app. Owlchat does not
          promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to
          you and/or works with the Android &amp; iOS version that you have
          installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept
          updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to
          stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time
          without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you
          otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted
          to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and
          (if needed) delete it from your device.
        </p>

          this page.
